\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This system is designed to interface with SPECjbb 2015 and make it a more user friendly.  The system will provide users with the ability to save an store various run settings for use with SPECjbb 2015. 

\section{Project Scope}
$<$Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, 
including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to 
corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document 
is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.$>$

\section{References}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \hyperlink{https://www.spec.org/jbb2015}{SPECjbb2015}

\end{enumerate}


\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
$<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.  
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product 
family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained 
product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the 
requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and 
identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major 
components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external 
interfaces can be helpful.$>$

SPECtate (the System) is open source software (OSS) released under the MIT License. It is not a standalone system, it is designed to be interfaced with SPECjbb2015 (the Benchmarking System). It provides a simple mechanism for users of the Benchmarking System to manage various JVM and benchmark configurations. It is not required to use the Benchmarking System. 



\section{Product Functions}
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram 
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

The main purpose of the System is to simplify configuration management for the user, specifically:




\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
$<$Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product.  
User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product 
functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational 
level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.  
Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the 
most important user classes for this product from those who are less important 
to satisfy.$>$

\section{Operating Environment}
The application will always run under a Unix environment.  Users may run the application remotely without access to a graphical user interface.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
$<$Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the 
developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware 
limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other 
applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel 
operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security 
considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the 
customerâ€™s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered 
software).$>$

\section{User Documentation}
$<$List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, 
and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any 
known user documentation delivery formats or standards.$>$
\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

$<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the 
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial 
components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating 
environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions 
are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the 
project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to 
reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for 
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
$<$Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software 
product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards 
or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout 
constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on 
every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on.  
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of 
the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface 
specification.$>$

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
$<$Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between 
the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include 
the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions 
between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be 
used.$>$

\section{Software Interfaces}
$<$Describe the connections between this product and other specific software 
components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, 
libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or 
messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each.  
Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to 
documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols.  
Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data 
sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a 
global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an 
implementation constraint.$>$

\section{Communications Interfaces}
$<$Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions 
required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server 
communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent 
message formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such 
as FTP or HTTP. Specify any communication security or encryption issues, data 
transfer rates, and synchronization mechanisms.$>$
